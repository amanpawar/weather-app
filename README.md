To run the project :

1. Install packages by `npm i` in both the directories client and server
2. To start the servers in dev mode , run `npm run dev` in both the directories separately
3. The FE should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000


To test the BE server :

Run `npm run test` in server directory

Description : I have created the frontend in next js and backend on node/express js and have used jest and supertest to create integration tests for BE server. The node version used was 18.16.0

Challenges Faced : I was not completely familiar with the usage of jest and supertest, so that took me time to integrate and test the code.
